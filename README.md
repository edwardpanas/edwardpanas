- 👋 Hi, I’m @edwardpanas
- 🤔 I’m an old school web developer: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SASS. (I remember when this stuff was created.)
- 🤓 After 20+ years of freelance work I landed my first W-2 developer gig.
  (Hope to retire from this job...just in case my boss reads this. LOL)
- ✝️ Proverbs 3:5-6 "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."
