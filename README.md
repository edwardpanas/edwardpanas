- 👋 Hi, I’m @edwardpanas.
- 🤩 I've been coding off & on since I was 8 years old and it still feels like magic to me.
- 🤔 I’m an old school web developer: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SASS. I remember when this most of this stuff was created.
- 🤓 After 20+ years of freelance work I landed my first W-2 developer gig in 2019. (Hope to retire from this job...just in case my boss reads this. LOL)
- ✝️ Proverbs 3:5-6 "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."
